# Todolist

This is an application that allows the user to create, edit, crossout and/or delete any task.

The user can add a new task in the input field and submit it, which will then appear in the list of tasks below the input field.
Clicking on a task will cross it out and mark it as completed in the backend; clicking again will undo this.
The user can change the task's name by clicking on the 'Edit' button next to that task, then they can modify the name in the input field above the list of tasks and click on the 'Submit' button to update it in the list of tasks.
Finally, the user can delete any task simply by clicking the '-' button next to that task.
